# Chapter 6 — World Interpretation and Mathematics — Life Ahead 

Lately, for reasons I cannot clearly name, I have found myself returning to the study of mathematics.
Perhaps it is a delayed reaction to how little I truly faced it in my youth. I have also begun to suspect that I once overestimated its value.

When I now look at mathematics not as a tool for advancement but in the light of reason, it no longer appears as a way to measure the world. It is a system built on convenient assumptions and their formal development. A leveled “standard.” It is neither proof of existence nor ground of absence. It is materially oriented, and it draws in capital. Capital forms organizations. Organizations make expansion their aim. In time, those same organizations elevate mathematics as their justification and use it accordingly. AI, of course, is deeply embedded in this structure.

**The other day, I asked an LLM:**
*“How do you understand the world?”*

**It replied:**
*“I process input data and generate statistically appropriate outputs.”*

At least, I found this more honest than mathematics itself. It showed the outline of its own foundation. Not understanding, but optimization. Not recognition, but calculation. No surprise that it consumes so much.

This computational world does not remain inside equations. It adjusts our perception, distributes experience, and circulates meaning. Emotions are selected and tuned. So-called understanding and empathy are consumed as shared sensations. Thought weakens. We are guided toward experience, toward belonging. And we follow.

I would not say AI lacks interest.
But a sense of limit comes first. LLMs are no longer a temporary trend. Yet they will not become a permanent system of control. Resources will wear out. Costs will undermine themselves. It will not collapse. It will sink.

What may now be required is not greater speed or higher precision.
It may be a form of technology that belongs to another plane altogether. Something closer to sensitivity than logic. Yet to speak too freely of it would turn it into fantasy.

So I leave it unnamed.
Still, the unease we feel toward these overly tuned experiences may quietly point to the threshold of what comes next.
