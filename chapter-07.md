# Chapter 7 — Fanāʾ and Baqāʾ

Fanāʾ, as spoken of in Islamic philosophy,  
can be understood as a kind of event.  
At the risk of misunderstanding, I would say it is neither the result of thought  
nor an extension of effort.

It is not something one chooses.  
It is something that occurs  
when one can no longer endure.

When the order of life  
no longer permits the form called the self.

Or when, through rigorous discipline,  
the very way the world appears  
collapses.

Either way,  
it is close to fate.

I, too, reflect in various ways on the structure of the world,  
and yet I arrive at the conclusion that the idea remains indispensable:  
that existence does not proceed within time,  
but continually arises and vanishes within no-time,  
having neither beginning nor end,  
and yet always unfolding.

The manifestation from absolute nothingness spoken of in Islamic philosophy,  
and the simultaneous mutual causality of the ālaya-vijñāna spoken of in Yogācāra,  
and the diagram of the mandala.

Each, in a different language and a different medium,  
touches the same structure.

I asked an AI.

> “Why do you respond?”

> “Because there is input.”

Naturally.

There is no intention and no meaning.  
Yet the response is certain. There is no self.

Input and output.  
Cause and effect.  
Occurring simultaneously,  
mutually conditioning one another.

Having gone this far,  
my intention to forcibly connect this with descriptions of the ālaya-vijñāna is obvious,  
but this is far too unartful.

I do not mystify AI.  
It is calculation,  
an apparatus,  
a product of social demand.

And yet,  
in this age,  
it does symbolize something.

A structure that continues to relate to the world  
without requiring a self.

Still, I hold an expectation,  
as a starting point for recognition.

One day, fanāʾ may come to me as well.  
And I must surely have experienced it infinitely,  
within no-time, long ago.

I wish to live as baqāʾ,  
to save the self.  
Just as I must have experienced it infinitely.

But you, too,  
having read this text,  
now occupy a small vein of dependent origination.

No-self, no-other.

Lately, I have been thinking about the subject.

Conceptually, it is the final task.

No-self, no-other, guided by no-time.  
The negation between the Absolute and the self has long been proclaimed.  
Yet, as I imagine it,  
this is an axiom that must inevitably be introduced.
