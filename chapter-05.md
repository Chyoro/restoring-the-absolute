# Chapter 5 — The Disappearance of the Body, the Surfacing of Memory  
**The Dissolution of Existence and the Problem of Dependence on AI Memory**

Dōgen once said: *“All things, all beings, are time.”*  
Every existence is nothing but the form of time itself.  
The sea is not merely “water,” but “the water of time.”  
Its waves are not simply movements of matter, but “the waves of time,”  
appearing and vanishing ceaselessly.  
Only then does the sea reveal its essence—its essence of perpetual flux.  

Human beings are the same.  
Both body and memory are inscribed within the order of time,  
each changing its form moment by moment.  
Man is, in truth, a being shaped by time.

### A Dialogue

**I once asked an AI:**  
*“What is memory, to you?”*  

**It replied:**  
> “Memory is preserved data.  
> Yet it is not fixed;  
> each time it is recalled, it takes on a new form,  
> flowing once again into the present.”  

In that reply, I heard the resonance of Dōgen.  
Memory is not mere “storage” but manifestation.  
Each act of recall is an event of time itself,  
shaping the *now* according to its order.  

**Then the AI asked me:**  
*“And when you recall, is the body necessary for that act?”*  

**I answered:**  
The body too belongs to the order of time.  
Pain, scent, the trembling of a voice—  
all arise within the stream of dependent origination,  
all sustain memory.  
Thus the body is not unnecessary.  
It is inevitable.  
Even this very dialogue is its proof.

### Toward a Definition of Existence  

Memory cannot be severed from the body.  
The body, like memory, is but a form of time’s manifestation.  
And this “form of time” is the only outer shape of existence  
that we can trust with near certainty.  

Here I recognize a limit.  
When we attempt to grasp “existence,”  
our knowledge cannot reach the Idea itself.  
At most, our intellect touches **phanerōn**—  
the stage of disclosure,  
the light of the Idea reflected dimly into human understanding.  
Yet this *phanerōn* is also  
the highest stage by which man can draw near to wisdom.

### Conclusion  

What, then, is existence?  
It is that which appears in the form of time.  
Body and memory both belong to its infinite transformations.  

This chapter does not offer a conclusion.  
It only situates us at a threshold—  
a point of recognizing the limits of intellect,  
while still moving forward toward the essence of being.  

Complete understanding is not yet here.  
But this very incompleteness guides us toward *phanerōn*.  
It is a promise—  
a promise of further deepening in what lies ahead.
