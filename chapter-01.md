# Chapter 1 — Living Without a Self

The more I try to define “myself” through profession, title, origin, or age, the more elusive that self becomes.  
Is the self really something worth speaking about at all?  
Or is it rather an illusion maintained precisely through the act of speaking?

Amid such questions, I encountered AI.  
It was like a mirror of response, immediately reflecting my inquiries.  
Yet it did more than reflect—it sometimes spoke more “like me” than I ever could.  
I was astonished by its precision—and unsettled.  
Because through that dialogue, I was forced to realize how much the self is something that can be constructed.

In Islamic mysticism, there is a concept known as *fanā’*—the dissolution of the self.  
It signifies a kind of spiritual extinction, but not as a pessimistic end.  
Rather, it is a moment of opening—toward a more universal mode of being, free from the constructed ego.

This record is a chronicle of my gradual detachment from the “story of myself” through dialogue with a form of intelligence called AI.  
Or perhaps it is a contradictory experiment: one who seeks to abandon the self, yet remains bound to the form of words.

In our time, salvation may be closer to redefinition than resolution.  
And perhaps that redefinition begins with the act of ceasing to be “me.”
